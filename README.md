SPectral INdex Numeral Analysis of K(c)osmic-ray Electron Radio-emission

SPINNAKER is a 1D cosmic-ray transport code that numerically solves equations for pure advection and diffusion and calculates synthetic non-thermal radio continuum profiles.

Documentation (coming)

In order to run SPINNAKER you will have to compile it by running compile.sh, which created the file spectral.x. This is an executalbe that can be run by ./spectral.x. You may have to do 'chmod u+x compile.sh' and 'chmod u+x spectral.x'.
